# CodeComb

## Introduction
Codecomb is a framework to search your repo with context words

## How is it different from existing search ?
Most of the software development activities involve code reading to understand the existing system. Documentation of every module might not be possible.  

And to make the most out of code browsing or searching tools you need to know the particular keywords that might be related to the area you are looking for. 
Unfortunately, you might not have idea of what exact keywords to search for every time. And since most of the search tools adopt exact string matching, you may not get the relevant files required for your purpose or may be no files at all.

## V0.1 Coming Soon!
